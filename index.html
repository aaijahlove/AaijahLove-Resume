        Hello, my name is Aaijah Love and I am a first year History student studying at the University of California, Riverside. In my free time, I enjoy reading a variety of literature, specifically classical, historical and philosophical works. I also have a soft spot for community service work, and really enjoy serving my community!<br><br>

       In the past, I have been Vice President of my high school Interact Community Service Club for two years and I am looking to soon transfer this passion for serving others over to the Rotary Club at my university! I have had numerous opportunities of leading community service events, ranging from providing assistance along with my club members at local elementary school events, to hosting our yearly Senior Citizen Proms for my community! We also have done various other acts of service like visiting our local veterans hospital every Veteranâ€™s day, volunteering to work snack stands for Little League events and working to provide relief for natural disaster victims through making blankets by hand and collecting goods to package and send out. All of the experiences Iâ€™ve had in community service were such a blast, and Iâ€™m so grateful to have been a part of them all.<br><br>

I am a bi-racial student of African American and Hispanic (Puerto Rican) descent, and I am the second in my family to attend university. Despite the limitations of growing up in San Bernardino, I have found ways to perform at the best of my ability with what I was given. Growing up with a single mother and my younger brother, I have had to make many sacrifices for the sake of my family and thus developed the work ethic and grit to achieve numerous goals. Due to all of this, Iâ€™ve become very ambitious for success in life, and enjoy challenging myself to see what I am capable of.<br><br>

With aspiring to help others in need, I am looking for a career in either protecting the rights of people through work in the Law, or by shaping the coming generations in Teaching. Especially with being shaped by teachers who gave me their full effort, despite the restrictions we had in a less-off neighborhood, I would love to be this light in someone elseâ€™s life. And as I am passionate about History and ensuring that the mistakes of the past are acknowledged and learned from, this works well in tandem with my love of serving others.<br><br>

Although I have yet to have any work or intern experiences with being a new college student, Iâ€™m very excited to put myself out there! And as a very flexible and approachable person, I believe I am a team player as well.<br><br>

Thereâ€™s a bit about me in a nutshell!
